# QQoL

Some quality of life improvements to vscode.

## Features
- [x] Merging line with previous line if a line only has indentation on it while deleting
- [x] Delete whitespace from lines that only contain whitespace on save

## Planned
- [ ] Displaying multiple overloaded signature helps simultaneously (if possible from an extension)
